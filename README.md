# ChatViewController

----------------

A sample functional chat controller implementation using the SlackTextViewController as its base class.

## TODO

+ Move boilerplate code implemented on the subclass elsewhere - Ideally, subclassing should be very simple with the possibility to customize chat through the use of Configuration objects
+ Continue improving the use of Configuration objects to expose the customization *only* desired by the user
